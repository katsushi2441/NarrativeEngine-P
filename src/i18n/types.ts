 * The app's chrome is styled for English: ALL-CAPS with wide letter-spacing
 * (`uppercase tracking-[0.2em]`). That does not survive translation —
 * `uppercase` is a no-op on Hangul, wide tracking makes Hangul read as
 * mangled, and Cyrillic runs ~30% longer than English and overflows
 * fixed-width controls.
 *
 * A locale declares its corrections HERE, in its own file, and never by
 * editing components. `applyLocale()` projects this onto the document root as
 * data-attributes; `src/index.css` reacts to them (see the LANGUAGE OVERRIDES
 * block at the bottom of that file).
