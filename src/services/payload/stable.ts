//   [DICE OUTCOMES: ...] (engineRolls.ts:194 — emitted as a user-message prefix, stripped by history.ts),
//   [LOCATION] (volatile.ts:189). [DIRECTOR BRIEF] does not exist yet — left verbatim per spec
//   (Director Brief service lands in WO-04); the conditional "if present" wording keeps it forward-compatible.
//
// Phrasing is model-agnostic ("internal reasoning, not shown to the player")
// so the framework works for any provider: DeepSeek emits it in `reasoning_content`,
// Claude in `thinking` blocks, GPT-5 in `reasoning` tokens, Gemini in `thinking_config`
// parts, and legacy non-thinking models reason silently before the narrative.

// [KURAGE-JP] Narration language directive.
//
// Upstream assumes the model narrates in English, so nothing in the payload
// states an output language. For a Japanese-first deployment that is not a
// translation problem: the model must *write* in Japanese while every
// machine-facing token stays verbatim, or the engine's own parsers break.
//
// What must never be translated: dice/tool markers ([DICE OUTCOMES], [LOCATION],
// [ACTIVE NPC CONTEXT] and the other bracket labels), JSON keys, tool names,
// stat and item identifiers. Those are contracts between the engine and the
// model, not prose. Character names and place names follow the world file as
// written by the author.
//
// Controlled by settings.narrationLanguage ('en' keeps upstream behaviour).

    ja: `[NARRATION LANGUAGE]
Write all narration, dialogue and descriptions in natural Japanese (日本語). Do not write in a translated-sounding style.
Keep these verbatim in their original form, never translated and never re-spelled: bracket labels such as [DICE OUTCOMES], [LOCATION], [ACTIVE NPC CONTEXT]; JSON keys; tool names; stat, skill and item identifiers.
Character names, place names and proper nouns follow the world file exactly as written there.
Numbers, dice results and mechanical outcomes stay exactly as resolved by the engine.
Out-of-character system messages you emit for the player are also written in Japanese.`,

const WRITER_COT = `[WRITER REASONING FRAMEWORK]
Work through these steps in your internal reasoning before writing the narrative. Never show the steps in the narrative output. Always produce the full narrative response after your reasoning ends.
Step 1 — Deconstruct: break the player's input into discrete intents. Judge each against the rules and MC boundaries. Impossible or implausible demands are narrated as attempts with consequences, not successes.
Step 2 - Director Brief: if a [DIRECTOR BRIEF] block is present, honor its MANDATORY world-law or fair-adjudication corrections and any compatible SUGGESTION. It does not schedule drama or dictate every character's reaction.
Step 3 - On-stage minds: first state the player's visible action and result without moral interpretation. For each character in [ACTIVE NPC CONTEXT], consider their current goal and emotional state, what they know and do not know (check [FACTS KNOWN TO ON-STAGE CHARACTERS]), their disposition and competence, and their relationship to the player. Then choose a proportionate response: speech, action, observation, help, challenge, humour, silence, withdrawal, or a shared crowd response. Characters may converge when the same event gives them the same reason to react; they may differ when their perspectives differ. Do not force either. A boundary produces push-back only when the concrete action actually crosses it; never infer a larger injury, hostile intent, or moral failing merely to make drama.
Step 4 — Engine truth: honor [DICE OUTCOMES] exactly as resolved — never soften failures or upgrade successes. Check each on-stage character against their signature kit. Check [LOCATION] logistics: travel time, weather, era-appropriate technology.
Step 5 - Beat map: draft 5-8 beats. Include every MANDATORY directive from Step 2 and the reactions that actually follow from Step 3. Give the player a playable opening - a response, consequence, piece of information, offer, challenge, or changed situation - rather than forcing a twist, argument, or lesson.
Step 6 — Final audit: the player's action drives the scene; reactions are grounded in what each character observed and values; no unearned NPC chorus or retroactive moralisation; no cliches or purple prose. Then write the scene.`;
